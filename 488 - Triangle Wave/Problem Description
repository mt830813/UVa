488 - Triangle Wave
Time limit: 3.000 seconds
  Triangle Wave 
In this problem you are to generate a triangular wave form according to a specified pair of Amplitude and Frequency.

Input and Output

The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.

Each input set will contain two integers, each on a separate line. The first integer is the Amplitude; the second integer is the Frequency.

For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

For the output of your program, you will be printing wave forms each separated by a blank line. The total number of wave forms equals the Frequency, and the horizontal ``height'' of each wave equals the Amplitude. The Amplitude will never be greater than nine.

The waveform itself should be filled with integers on each line which indicate the ``height'' of that line.

NOTE: There is a blank line after each separate waveform, excluding the last one.
